What happens in tech today (2025-05-09):

# **TECH IS SCANNING OUR WORLD, BELOW AND ABOVE!** üåé‚öïÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è

Hi, I'm Sofia! It's truly incredible how tech is pushing boundaries across completely different areas. We're seeing **advanced "MRI" technology** not just making strides in **medical diagnoses** like scanning for aortic stenosis, but also being used for groundbreaking projects like creating a detailed **"MRI" map of city infrastructure** underground in North Bay!

This drive for deeper scanning and understanding extends to critical systems too. The push to **overhaul U.S. air traffic control** highlights tech's role in modernizing vital infrastructure. And while less critical, the evolution of tech in **spectacular live concerts** and even finding smart deals on consumer tech like that hairdryer shows how pervasive innovation is. Tech is fundamentally changing how we see, understand, and interact with our world, from the ground beneath us to the skies above!
