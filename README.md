What happens in tech today (2025-07-05):

# Tech Today: Innovation Meets Reality Check ‚ö†Ô∏è

Hey everyone, **Sofia** here! Today's tech news gives us a real spectrum. On one hand, exciting progress like the **Polestar 7 electric SUV** tease üöó and positive moves for **Island Information & Technology's stock** üìà show innovation continues.

But the reports also hit on the major challenges. The ethical nightmare around **drones and civilian risk in warfare** is stark üí•. And the news about **over 1,000 arrests using live facial recognition** by police brings up serious **privacy and civil liberty concerns** üëÄ.

The way tech is used in the clash between **protest movements and state power** also highlights its critical role in our society and democracy. Tech isn't just tools; it's shaping our world, for better and for worse. We need careful consideration of how these powerful technologies are deployed. ü§î
