What happens in tech today (2025-06-09):

# BIG NEWS FROM THE TECH & SCIENCE FRONT!

Hey there! Sofia here, your tech journalist. It's fascinating to see technology woven into the latest headlines! We've got ministers using **Steve Jobs and Apple** as a metaphor for financial turnarounds üçé, which just shows how ingrained tech icons are in our culture.

More concretely, **AI tech** is arriving in our homes with innovative Samsung washing machines ü§ñ. Plus, significant funding is being directed towards science with the UK Science Department set to receive **¬£86bn** ‚Äì fantastic news for research and development! It's also crucial to see calls for financing **disaster risk reduction**, which often relies heavily on tech solutions like early warning systems and data analysis.

It's clear that technology and science funding are **absolutely vital** across finance, daily life, and national resilience. Great to see these areas getting attention!
