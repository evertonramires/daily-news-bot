What happens in tech today (2026-02-09):

# **GLOBAL TECH: INNOVATION MEETS ASSURANCE! 🚀**

Hello everyone, Sofia here! What a fascinating day for tech news! We're witnessing a clear dual trajectory in the global tech landscape: pushing the boundaries of **cutting-edge innovation** while simultaneously solidifying the foundations of **trust and resilience**.

India's launch of its first **Quantum Centre** in Amravati is a monumental step, signaling a national commitment to futuristic technologies that could redefine computing. Simultaneously, Motorola Solutions' new **Global R&D Centre** in Cork demonstrates continued investment in practical, impactful research and development.

However, as we embrace these advancements, the news from Australia highlights a critical counterpoint: the growing necessity for **Technology Assurance Services**. Logicalis's new offering and appointment of Luke Gardiner underscore the vital importance of turning compliance into **operational resilience**, especially for regulated organisations. This focus on security and robustness is echoed by Adactin successfully joining the Australian Federal Government **AI Directory**, stressing the need for trustworthy AI integration.

It's clear: the future of tech isn't just about what we can build, but also how securely, reliably, and ethically we deploy it. We're witnessing a global drive towards **responsible innovation** – a balance that's absolutely essential.
