What happens in tech today (2025-06-10):

# Tech, Trade, and the Push for Independence! üöÄüåç

Hey there, I'm Sofia! Today's news paints a clear picture: **technology is a battleground** in global politics. The **US-China trade talks in London** continue to be a complex puzzle, reflecting deep tensions over crucial tech areas and supply chains. ü§î

But look over to Canada! Quebec's **$10 million investment** in developing **Canadian satellite launch tech** is a huge step! üá®üá¶üõ∞Ô∏è This isn't just a space story; it's about building **strategic national capability**. In a world marked by trade uncertainties and competition (like the US-China situation), having your own independent access to space is incredibly valuable. It underscores how nations are investing heavily to secure their place in key tech sectors and reduce reliance on others. **Tech independence** is becoming a major theme!
