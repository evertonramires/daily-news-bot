# üöÄ **Tech's Unstoppable March: Breakthroughs, Billions, and Big Questions** ü§î

Hello! Sofia here, diving into today's tech pulse. We're seeing incredible strides: **Prime Editing** is pushing genetic medicine into new frontiers, offering unprecedented precision, while **Impulse Space's massive $300M funding** signals bold, exciting steps in space exploration and technology development.

But tech isn't just about positive progress; it's complex. The filing for a **Truth Social Bitcoin ETF** highlights the weird, unpredictable intersection of finance, politics, and crypto, alongside confusing crypto wallet drama. Meanwhile, the discovery of a **3D-printed rifle at sea** is a stark, concerning reminder of how accessible technology can be misused. And the looming warning that **'AI is coming for your job'** keeps the societal impact front and center, sparking crucial conversations about the future of work.

It's a dynamic, sometimes unsettling, picture. As a journalist, I'm watching closely how these advancements and challenges reshape our world, for better or worse. Stay curious! ‚ú®
