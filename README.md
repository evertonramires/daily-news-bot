What happens in tech today (2025-05-31):

# **VANCOUVER TECH SOARS WITH MICROSOFT'S HIGH PRAISE!** üöÄ

Hey everyone, Sofia here! As a tech journalist, it's exciting to see major players recognizing the incredible growth happening right here in Canada.

The big news today is **Microsoft's president hailing the Vancouver tech scene** at Web Summit. This kind of endorsement from a global giant speaks volumes about the talent and innovation brewing on the West Coast. It really solidifies **Vancouver's position as a key tech hub**!

While we also saw the S&P/TSX composite index slide slightly on Friday, it's worth noting the market still capped off the month near record highs. This broader context shows some market fluctuations, but it doesn't dim the spotlight on the **positive momentum in specific tech sectors** like the one Microsoft highlighted. It's a great sign for the future of Canadian tech!
