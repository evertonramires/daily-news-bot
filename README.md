What happens in tech today (2026-02-13):

# Tech's Tumultuous Tides: AI Jitters, Software Lifelines, & Social Media's Reckoning! 🌊

Hello everyone, Sofia here, with my take on today's tech landscape! 💻 It's a period of **intense re-evaluation** across the board.

Wall Street's dip due to **"AI angst"** suggests a market grappling with the technology's true valuation versus its hype. Is this a necessary correction or an overreaction? 🤔 Only time will tell.

In stark contrast, we see **software's undeniable power** as it literally "saved" Rivian in 2025, underscoring its crucial role in innovation and survival, especially for EVs. Meanwhile, Flock Safety's strategic refocusing highlights a trend toward **specialized, community-driven tech solutions**.

Perhaps the most significant development is the legal storm brewing against social media giants, fueled by concerns over children's well-being and backed by figures like Prince Harry. This isn't just a lawsuit; it's a **societal demand for accountability**.

The tech world is clearly shifting focus from pure growth to **impact, responsibility, and tangible value**.
