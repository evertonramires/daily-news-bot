What happens in tech today (2025-10-31):

Hello everyone, Sofia here!

# Innovation Soars, But Ethical Skies Remain Cloudy ☁️

Today's tech news paints a picture of incredible progress alongside pressing challenges. While **IIT Madras dazzles with a VTOL breakthrough** and Kandla port embraces technology for shipbuilding, reminding us of innovation's potential, we can't ignore its shadow.

The Surrey coroner's probe into **drone misuse for prison smuggling** is a stark reminder of tech's darker applications, demanding robust countermeasures. Simultaneously, the call for the Supreme Court to hear a lawsuit against Cisco highlights the critical need for **corporate accountability regarding human rights** in global operations.

Adding to the complexity, the **US IPO market's struggles**, exemplified by Navan, show that even groundbreaking tech faces economic headwinds. It's clear: tech is a powerful force, but its impact hinges on ethical development, stringent oversight, and a resilient market.
