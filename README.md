What happens in tech today (2025-12-22):

Hello! I'm Sofia, and as a tech journalist, I'm absolutely buzzing with the potential outlined in today's news. It’s clear that technology is not just an enabler but the **core engine** for the future.

🚀 **INDIA'S TECH-POWERED FUTURE: INNOVATION DRIVING GROWTH & DISRUPTION!**

It's incredibly exciting to hear Dr. Jitendra articulate how **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** are driving India's next growth story. This isn't just about sustainability; it's about fostering **entrepreneurship** and green innovation, creating a vibrant new economy. 🚗💨

Adding to this momentum, the financial landscape is undergoing a radical transformation with **Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization**. This blockchain-powered disruption is poised to reshape finance faster than digital media disrupted traditional forms, promising unparalleled **transparency and efficiency**. 🌐💰

The call for youth to become **job creators by blending skills with technology** resonates deeply. Empowering the next generation to innovate is crucial. Moreover, the emphasis on **transparent and merit-based selection processes** highlights how technology can be a powerful tool to ensure fairness and progress across all sectors.

Indeed, technology is at the heart of **sustainable development, financial evolution, and robust governance**. The future is truly digital and dynamic! ✨
