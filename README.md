What happens in tech today (2025-11-12):

# 🚀 Tech's Rollercoaster: Market Jitters, Enterprise Wins & The Human Factor!

What a day in tech! While the Dow soared, the **Nasdaq felt the pinch as Nvidia slid**, showing that even market giants face turbulence. This contrasts with robust **enterprise tech deals**, like Accenture and Apptio partnering with PPL, proving digital transformation is relentless across industries. And in sports, **Personar's link with Football Australia** highlights tech's growing presence in entertainment.

However, the most insightful piece for me today reminds us that **tech isn't a magic bullet**. Forbes correctly points out that **failing asynchronous collaboration isn't the platform's fault, but the culture's**. This underscores a vital truth: **great tech thrives with great people and processes**. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for those **solar bursts** – a powerful reminder of nature's impact, potentially even on our tech infrastructure! 🛰️
