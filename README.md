What happens in tech today (2025-10-25):

# üöÄ The Future is Intelligent: AI & Robotics Set the Pace!

Hello! Sofia here, buzzing about today's tech headlines! It's clear that **AI and robotics are driving forces**, shaping our future. Novanta's move to establish **ISO safety standards for humanoid robots** is a critical step, ensuring these innovations are both groundbreaking and secure. This foundation is essential for the widespread adoption we anticipate.

Meanwhile, the giants like **Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are poised for a "very strong" earnings season**, reaffirming the robust health of the core tech sector. This financial strength provides the capital needed for continued R&D in areas like AI.

Crucially, we're seeing **AI's transformative power extend beyond pure tech, with UnitedHealth testing new AI systems**. This highlights how intelligent automation is not just for the tech companies anymore; it's revolutionizing industries from healthcare to, eventually, perhaps even more efficient global trade. The future is intelligent, and it's happening now! ‚ú®
