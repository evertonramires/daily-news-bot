From solid rocket motor advancements propelling us forward üöÄ, to China's DeepSeek AI still leaning on **crucial US technology**, it's clear that **innovation knows no borders, yet often thrives on global interdependence**. Samsung's expanding manufacturing in India further highlights the **dynamic shifts in global supply chains**. But beyond the hardware, the human element is paramount: leaders must adopt **new mindsets for the digital future**, and even traditional services, like Hong Kong taxis, need to **strategically embrace a digital-first approach** to truly elevate their offerings. **Adaptability and collaboration** are the undeniable hallmarks of progress.
